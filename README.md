## NSQIP Reproducibility Project

This is the GitHub repository containing the code for, "Reproducibility Matters: Improving NSQIP Research in (Plastic) Surgery." Files in this repository include code for reproducing three peer-reviewed plastic surgery articles using the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP) database. Throughout the analysis, commentary was added with methodological excerpts from the original articles followed by questions that arose in attempting to code the analysis for that section of the original methods.

### Abstract
BACKGROUND  
Reproducibility is a key tenet of scientific study; however, attempts to reproduce published work are often unsuccessful. The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database tracks 30-day postoperative outcomes across >250 perioperative variables. This investigation replicates three plastic surgery studies, evaluating the impact of undisclosed methodological decisions on reproducibility.  

STUDY DESIGN  
A PubMed search identified studies using NSQIP. Three plastic surgery articles were selected to reproduce. Each study's methodology was reviewed, and independent analyses by two authors were performed following the original methods and NSQIP data from 2005-2023. Reproduced statistical results were compared with published findings.  

RESULTS  
The literature search identified 2,699 studies using NSQIP data, including 252 plastic surgery articles. In recreating three plastic surgery articles, four elements were identified as root causes of irreproducibilityâ€”cohort selection, variable definition, handling of missing data, and statistical details.  Two independent analyses failed to recreate all three patient cohorts due to the inconsistent reporting of CPT codes. Further, vague variable definition and handling of missing data impacted both cohort size and statistical analyses. Finally, incomplete statistical details including variable selection, models used, and outcome definitions contributed to the lack of faithful reproduction.  

CONCLUSIONS  
NSQIP is a widely used database in plastic surgery; however, three NSQIP-based articles were unable to be reproduced. As the original studies were well-designed and peer-reviewed, these discrepancies highlight how unreported methodological choices influence results, hindering reproducibility. Journals should encourage clear and complete methodological reporting, including code publication, to enhance verification and trust in NSQIP-based research.
